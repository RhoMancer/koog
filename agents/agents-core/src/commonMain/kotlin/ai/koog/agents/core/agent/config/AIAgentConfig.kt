/**
 * Configuration class for an AI agent that specifies the prompt, execution parameters, and behavior.
 *
 * This class is responsible for defining the various settings and components required
 * for an AI agent to operate. It includes the prompt configuration, iteration limits,
 * and strategies for handling missing tools during execution.
 *
 * @param prompt The initial prompt configuration for the agent, encapsulating messages, model, and parameters.
 * @param model The model to use for the agent's prompt execution
 * @param maxAgentIterations The maximum number of iterations allowed for an agent during its execution to prevent infinite loops.
 * @param missingToolsConversionStrategy Strategy used to determine how tool calls,
 *        present in the prompt but lacking definitions, are handled during agent execution.
 *        This property provides a mechanism to convert or format missing tool calls and result messages when they occur,
 *        typically due to differences in tool sets between steps or subgraphs while the same history is reused.
 *        This ensures the prompt remains consistent and readable for the model, even with undefined tools.
