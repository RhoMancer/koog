# Module agents-planner

Module for implementing planning capabilities in AI agents.

## Overview

The agents-planner module provides components for creating AI agents that can plan and execute multi-step tasks through iterative planning cycles.
Each planning cycle builds or updates a plan based on the current state, executes a step from the plan, and checks if the goal has been achieved.

This module also provides GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning) that use search algorithms to find optimal action sequences based on predefined goals and actions.
